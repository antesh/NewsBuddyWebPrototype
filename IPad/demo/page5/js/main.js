Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore’s statement that the operation was a message to all countries inimical to India, predictably set off a furore in Pakistan. At a time when India-Pakistan relations are at a standstill with no sign of a dialogue in sight, levels of rhetoric have risen, much of it coming from Pakistan.<br>Traditionally, “hot pursuit” is a term that has raised Pakistan’s hackles. After the nuclear tests in 1998, senior Minister L.K. Advani’s remarks on “hot pursuit” elicited a high-decibel response from Pakistan. This time, besides a resolution in the Pakistan Senate, the Prime Minister, the Interior Minister and the Chief of the Army Staff have all gone hammer and tongs at India. It is unfortunate that the action in Myanmar has triggered a fresh slide in relations with Pakistan on account of breast-beating and credit-hunting by the Modi government. A robust response to the killing of 20 soldiers in Manipur on June 4 was called for, but safeguarding the space to conduct such operations in the future is also critical for India’s long-term strategy. As military analysts have pointed out, the June 9 operation is not the first of its kind undertaken by the Indian Army — which as a force will continue to need the support of the Myanmar authorities. So, while guarding the sanctity of India’s borders and the lives of its soldiers and citizens, the long-term strategy must be to erode the militant strength. In fact, that must be the single-point strategic agenda.<br>India’s national interest must be kept paramount. Short-term political gains coming from loud statements of the kind made by Mr. Rathore can only damage India’s image and risk antagonising a neighbour like Myanmar. Interestingly, the Minister used the hashtag #ManipurRevenge while sending out Twitter messages about the operation. Such sentiments, even when they come from a junior Minister, cannot be condoned. At all times the necessary distinction between the actions of a state and those of a terror organisation must be kept in mind. Reports in the Manipur media suggest that so far the local police have not received any report on the Army operation; nor have any bodies of militants been handed over to them. Given the claims made by the government, it is essential that evidence of the “success” of such an operation be shared appropriately. Also, Delhi must reflect on why on such occasions tact and silence may help more than seeking credit and political capital publicly.";

The Delhi Law Minister, who allegedly holds two fake educational degrees, resigned hours after a court sent him to police custody. It must be said that the AAP has handled the issue of Mr. Tomar’s qualifications with a complete lack of political nous. This has been the subject matter of a case in the Delhi High Court after the issue came up in February, and the party could have either asked the Minister to step down till he was cleared of the charges, or simply made his degree diplomas public on its website. It might be said that the AAP deserves sympathy in its ongoing face-off with a Goliath of a Centre, but lapses such as these are but another reminder that it could no longer really claim to be a party with a difference. The Delhi Police have gone strictly by the letter of the law in ordering the arrest. However, the manner in which they have gone about the process has left no one in doubt that it has essentially been a show of strength against a political party that is determined to put an end to corruption. To arrest Mr. Tomar the Delhi Police sent a posse of 40 officers, and then deployed heavy security around the police station where he was being held. The police worked late into the night to file a first information report, got it signed by Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung around midnight, and then appeared at Mr. Tomar’s residence around 6 a.m. to make the arrest. The sudden drive and determination to arrest on the basis of charges of forgery a person who is hardly likely to go absconding, made it seem politically motivated.<br>The governmental tussle over Delhi has meanwhile reached its zenith, and one battleground is the State’s Anti-Corruption Branch. The Lt. Governor recently created a senior post in the ACB so that he could post an officer of his choice who, incidentally, was conducting the investigations when a farmer committed suicide at the venue of an AAP rally. The AAP cried foul and ordered him sent back. That order was cancelled by the Lt. Governor. In retaliation, the AAP transferred out the official who had appointed him. All of this points to just another bizarre turn to a bizarre situation where the two governments just seem to be itching for a fight. The people of Delhi, interminably caught in the crossfire, may be the only real losers.";

The restoration was on a technicality — the meeting of the study circle that supposedly violated the guidelines for student groups was held on April 14, four days before the institute publicised the guidelines on its website. But after hours of discussion with representatives of the study circle, the IIT-M management also agreed to look into issues raised by the APSC with regard to uniform application of the guidelines for independent student bodies. While some of the requests for modification of the guidelines would be implemented by the Office of the Dean (Students), the others would be taken up for consideration by the Student Affairs Council, the Board of Students and the Senate in due course “as per established procedure”. That the management did not stand on prestige after members of the APSC campaigned against the withdrawal of recognition as an issue of freedom of expression is a good sign, and the student representatives would do well to drop their demand for an unconditional apology. The withdrawal of recognition was a mistake. With that mistake corrected, matters must now be allowed to rest.<br>The episode, beginning with the hasty withdrawal of recognition based on an anonymous complaint to the Ministry of Human Resource Development, is a reminder of the vulnerability of freedom of expression in the face of institutional authority. Quite unmistakably, the controversy is closely related to recent attempts of the Sangh Parivar and Hindutva elements to appropriate the name of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. A study circle that sought to bring his legacy in line with that of the iconoclast Periyar (notwithstanding some irreconcilable ideological differences between the two) must have upset many in the ruling establishment. Indeed, the RSS supported the withdrawal of recognition on the ground that the study circle was indicative of the pervasiveness of the ‘red’ ideology of the communists on campuses, and that while Ambedkar might not have adhered to all the tenets of Hindutva, he was certainly anti-communist. As one of the charges against the study circle was that it was extremely critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the inescapable conclusion is that the withdrawal of recognition came at the prompting of the powers-that-be in New Delhi. In such a context, the study circle’s success in its battle for recognition is surely a victory for liberal forces, and a blow for freedom of expression.";

It is difficult to avoid the impression that the government is showing excessive zeal as well as a tendency to use its employees and institutions to propagate its own view of culture and tradition. Mobilising staff members and students seems to be this regime’s way of promoting an idea. If it was Good Governance Day last Christmas, it will be International Yoga Day on June 21. It is indeed true that Prime Minister Modi’s address to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2014 provided the platform for the international community to recognise the importance of yoga. In December, the UNGA passed a resolution with the backing of over 170 countries to designate June 21 as International Yoga Day. No doubt, the benefits of yoga ought to be widely disseminated. However, does promoting it require the mobilisation of tens of thousands of people at Rajpath in Delhi for a massive demonstration? There are apprehensions that employees and students would be asked to participate in related events on a Sunday, even though it has not been made mandatory.<br>The government is even aiming for an entry in the Guinness World Records for the single largest yoga demonstration. It appears that having international impact is a key objective behind the promotional activities. If yoga is all about health, peace and harmony, there really is no need for a demonstrative approach to it. The visible presence of the state in the promotion of yoga will only detract from the idea of making it a people’s movement. Rather, the government’s role should be confined to providing facilities for the practice of yoga in various institutions under it and disseminating information about its benefits. A related issue that has given a sectarian dimension to the yoga campaign concerns a perception that the practice of yoga, especially the surya namaskar part of it, is against the tenets of Islam. Recognising this, the government has dropped surya namaskar from the list of asanas to be performed on June 21. While it is true that yoga is part of a wider heritage and attracts practitioners from among adherents of various religions, the government is obviously unable to convince everyone that its programmes are free of all religious or cultural association. It should work to remove its initiatives from areas of contestation so that even programmes having universal value do not take the hue of its ideology.";

The U.S.-led coalition’s bombing campaign shows no sign of checking its momentum. Barring some setbacks suffered at the hands of Kurdish and Shia militias, IS has expanded its zone of influence beyond its base in ‘Syraq’ over the year. It recently captured Ramadi, the capital of Iraq’s Anbar province, and the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra. It now has branches in countries including Lebanon, Libya, Afghanistan and Nigeria. President Barack Obama all but admitted on June 10, the anniversary of the fall of Mosul, as he ordered an additional 450 military advisers to join the 3,500 already in Iraq, that his anti-IS strategy wasn’t working. To be sure, IS has no dearth of enemies in the battlefield. The Syrian and Iraqi armies have declared war on it; Gulf monarchies are a party to a U.S.-led coalition bombing IS locations; Egypt had struck IS militants in Libya; and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia militia, has said it would fight IS along the Lebanon-Syria border. Still, why does IS appear so formidable?<br>IS’s advantage perhaps is that its rivals have no coordinated strategy: they are driven not by a common goal of defeating the enemy but by their own self-interest and sectarian calculations. In Syria, the regime of Bashar al Assad is the most potent force against IS. But the U.S. and its allies such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar want a regime change in Damascus. The efforts of Saudi Arabia and Turkey to weaken the Syrian regime are helping IS grow. In Iraq, the army, disbanded and rebuilt by the Americans, is largely sectarian and too inefficient to mount a major attack on its own. The Hezbollah may be able to protect the Lebanese-Syrian border from IS, but it is considered a terrorist outfit by the U.S., and an Iranian lackey by the Saudis. The Kurdish guerrillas in the Syrian and Turkish border regions had resisted IS effectively, but Turkey doesn’t want them to be brought into the anti-IS coalition. Iran has sent Shia militia groups to the battle-front, but they are viewed with suspicion in Iraq’s Sunni-dominated areas owing to sectarian reasons. IS feeds off this complex sectarian-geopolitical game, and with savagery and extremism tightens its grip over victims. But all this doesn’t mean IS is invincible: it could be defeated, as Kobane and Tikrit show. But to turn such isolated victories into a comprehensive triumph, the forces battling IS need to come up with a cohesive strategy cutting across sectarian fault-lines. Until that happens, West Asia will continue to see more bloodshed.";

U.S. President Barack Obama in fact accused Mr. Putin of “wrecking his country in pursuit of a wrong-headed desire to recreate the glories of the Soviet empire”. Russia countered by warning that it would prolong its own counter-sanctions, indicating there would not be any change in its Ukraine policy. While all this is happening, a fresh outbreak of violence between government troops and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine is threatening to derail a tenuous ceasefire. Ukraine is paying a heavy price for this stand-off. It has lost Crimea to Russia, is fighting a deadly civil war in the east, and its economy is in a state of collapse, it having contracted by nearly 18 per cent in the first quarter of 2015.<br>The real crisis of Ukraine is that it is caught in a game of one-upmanship between the West and Russia. The West wants to punish Russia for its annexation of Crimea and for helping separatists in eastern Ukraine. Moscow, on the other hand, sees Western involvement in the ouster of Ukraine’s pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych, and seems determined to resist the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation’s outreach to its backyard. If the West’s real intention is to get Russia to change its policy towards Ukraine, it should rethink its sanctions regime, which has been demonstrably ineffective over the past 15 months. Supporters of the sanctions might argue that those worked in the case of Iran and might work in Russia’s case as well. But Russia is not Iran. It is a geopolitical giant, a former superpower and a huge country that still has substantial leveraging power in Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Given the way policy-making works in the Kremlin, it is illogical to believe that any kind of coercion would work against Mr. Putin. Besides, there is little to suggest that the Western policy of isolating Russia is working at all. More than a year after Russia was suspended from the G-8 following its annexation of Crimea, the leading powers still need Russia to deal with pressing global issues ranging from the Iranian nuclear talks to the Syrian civil war. So a more pragmatic approach would be to start a diplomatic engagement in a mutually conducive environment. The inept handling by both sides of what was a domestic issue in Ukraine has turned it into a regional problem. Left unchecked, the problem could well turn into a war. It is high time the West and Moscow set aside rhetoric and started addressing the problem directly.";

The forecast now talks of 88 per cent of the long-period average, down from the preliminary figure of 93 per cent. The revised estimate is indeed cause for concern, as it holds the possibility of the country being pushed into a drought situation. These are forward-looking numbers no doubt. Yet the signals can hardly be ignored. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has sought to talk up the sentiment by suggesting that the fears are exaggerated, and he may well be right. In his view, the geographical distribution of rainfall and its timing will matter more than the total volume of precipitation. Yet, policy-planners at the fiscal and monetary levels have not shied away from articulating their anxiety. The Centre has said it is ready to face a deficit monsoon. Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh has made it clear that the situation is being monitored on a daily basis and that a ‘contingency plan’ is in place. The immediate worry, nay task, is to quickly devise an emergency plan to tackle the social and economic consequences of a possible drought. In the near-term, the government may do well to prepare a ready-to-roll out action programme to provide farmers a support system and fallback mechanism to ensure that they aren’t consumed by the severity of the impact, should there be a drought. This could well prove to be one of the toughest tests yet for the year-old Narendra Modi government. To minimise the annual concerns on this front, governments at the Centre and the States will have to go beyond mere mitigation strategies and work out a long-term irrigation plan in an integrated and holistic manner to optimise the groundwater potential as well.<br>If the forecast does come true, however, India could be facing the 12th worst drought since 1950. Already hit by unseasonal rain during the rabi season, this portends further trouble during the kharif cycle. This could lead to serious problems on the food front with consequences on the price situation. Already, lack of rural demand is dragging the economy down. The inflation-focussed Reserve Bank of India will have no more leeway to cut the interest rate in such a situation. Three quick rate cuts by the RBI totalling 75 basis points this year have not really seen any major reduction in lending rates by banks at the ground level. With mounting stressed assets and poor credit off-take, the banking industry has so far chosen to be a reluctant actor in the play. The missing X-Factor has conspired with the existing shortfalls in capacity utilisation to make the industry look forlorn. The situation demands proactive action.';
