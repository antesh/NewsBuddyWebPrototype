Our effort is to make Delhi an attractive tourist destination. The bridge at Wazirabad will soon add to Delhi\’s skyline. The plan is to make it a landmark that will beautify the city as well as the ease traffic conditions,” said Tomar after inaugurating the loop. According to officials, the entire Signature Bridge project is to be completed by March next year.<br>The newly opened loop that connects Wazirabad to ISBT is an 850-metre stretch that is likely to reduce travel time for commuters by almost 20 minutes.<br>Senior officials from the tourism department said that by using the loop, commuters will have to travel two kilometers less than the route they usually take to reach ISBT now.<br>As of now, commuters coming from Haryana have to take a right from Wazirabad and then take a U-turn again from Burari to reach ISBT. Though traffic is likely to move faster in the stretch, there will be little effect on congestion in the area.<br>\“This project will ensure sustainable growth. All the government agencies are doing their bit to protect the environment. The travel time will go now as will the fuel consumption for the bridge users. This will reduce pollution levels,\” said Shishir Bansal, project manager, tourism department.<br>This is the fourth flyover loop, independent of the main bridge, which has been opened for public use. Before this, the 1.5-kilometre flyover on the Outer Ring Road — covering four intersections at Timarpur, Nehru Vihar, Wazirabad and Mukherjee Nagar, Khajuri Khas flyover and Mukarba Chowk carriageway — had been thrown open for the public.<br>After Thursday’s inauguration, four other loops connected to the main bridge remain pending.<br>\“Since these four loops are connected to the main bridge, it cannot be opened unless the main bridge is completed,” added Bansal. The project, which was started in 2004 by then chief minister Sheila Dikshit, has missed three deadlines already.";

So the problem is not availability but distribution. Last year, power was affected for 10 days after a storm hit the city. This year, we have been gearing up for better distribution,\” a government official said.<br>Power demand in the city is expected to touch 6,500 MW this year. Last year, it peaked at 5,925 MW in July -- the highest ever recorded in any city in India.<br>\“We have punitive provisions but these cannot be based on hypothetical situations. If a discom fails to live up to the promise it has made, an enquiry will be made and accordingly action will be taken,” said a Delhi Energy Regulatory Commission official.<br>Discoms are currently looking at preventive maintenance, load balancing at the sub stations, deployment of additional manpower and setting up a dedicated team for monitoring complaints.<br>WATER PREPAREDNESS The Delhi Jal Board, which has been asked by the government to generate more revenue to feed the subsidy, is better placed to meet the city’s water demand this summer.<br>According to senior DJB officials, the infrastructure has improved massively this year and that will help the city tide over a water crisis in summers.<br>\“We believe there will be no problem. Dwarka Water Treatment Plant has started to function. It is already providing 25 MGD water daily and has a capacity of 40 MGD in total. Though the network is not ready to tackle that much capacity as of now, it should be ready in another two to three months,\” said a senior DJB official.<br>An official said, if Haryana fulfils its end of the bargain and provides the amount of water that it is supposed to, the city will tide over the summer without any problem.<br>\“The estimated requirement of water is 210 litres per person per day in summer. This is 40 litres more as compared to the requirement in winter. Considering that all water treatment plants have been made functional this year, it seems that the city is better placed to tackle the problem,\” said Sanjay Sharma, research head, Citizens Front for Water Democracy.\nAccording to Kapil Mishra, vice chairperson of DJB, they will hold Haryana to its promise of providing water to Delhi. \“The Supreme Court has ordered Haryana to release water. It will be contempt of court if they do not. We have improved the infrastructure. We are getting new tankers and involving people as well as MLAs to make sure that everything is transparent,\” Mishra said.";
