Two children each from UP and Nepal were among those rescued.<br>East Champaran labour superintendent Sanjeev Kumar said Saturday’s raid was the latest in a string of anti-trafficking operations in recent days.<br>\“All the children were from very poor families. The governments had recently given ` 1,800 each to over 100 such children in East Champaran alone for their rehabilitation,\” he said.<br>A social worker said rehabilitation measures were hardly enough and effective to stop these children from falling into the traffickers’ trap again.br<>An SSB official said an arrested trafficker revealed during interrogation that parents of some of the rescued children were working as labourers in Nepal. \“But after the Nepal disaster, they became jobless and vulnerable to the lure of money and persuasive powers of middlemen engaged by the trafficking racket.\”<br>Commandant of the SSB’s 13th battalion, Rakesh Kumar Sinha, said his men had rescued from trafficking gangs over 250 children and women since 2013. \“We alerted all 18 border outposts of the SSB to keep an eye open for human traffickers after the Nepal quake. The latest rescue is an outcome of that alert.\”";

But it has proposed to give every resident — and not just citizen — the right to complain if public authorities do not deliver services within promised deadlines.<br>It had also proposed to set up commissions at the central and state levels to hear appeals.<br>Modi, however, had his reservations. The PM’s views were conveyed to the department of administrative reforms and public grievances (DARPG) when it sought permission to circulate the Right to Services and Grievances Redressal Bill 2014 to ascertain views of other ministries.<br>\“The proposed bill envisages establishment of central Public Grievances Redressal Commission and State Public Grievances Redressal Commission similar to that in case of the Right to Information Act. This implies another hierarchy of organisational structure in addition to several others. This aspect needs to be revisited,\” the PMO said in a note to DARPG, quoting the PM’s \“observations\”.<br>Later, the PMO asked the administrative reforms department to explore the possibility of getting the central and state information commissions to double up as grievance redressal panels by dedicating one or two commissioners to hear grievances.<br>Or, the department could explore the possibility of setting up a watchdog by an executive direction on the lines of the banking ombudsman \“which shall not have the trappings of a final appellate authority for grievance redress for a group of ministries\”.<br>\“Both propositions are flawed,” said activist Anjali Bhardwaj. \“Given the sheer number of grievances that will reach the commission, 1, 2 or even 10 commissioners wouldn’t be sufficient ... Also, it is important that the final appellate authority should have statutory powers and be set up across the country, not just Delhi or the state capitals\”.";

It is understood that Li tried to assure Modi that Chinese activities in PoK were confined to development and designed to wean the populace from fundamentalism.<br>He rather condescendingly said India should not be unduly worried about China’s activities in PoK as they are harmless in nature.<br>Signalling that New Delhi, like Beijing, will not move an inch on its core interests, Modi made it clear that PoK is Indian territory under dispute with Pakistan and expressed his serious concern over China developing a $46 billion corridor linking Kashgar to Gwadar via PoK.<br>Modi apparently went a step further when he asked Li how Beijing would feel if New Delhi allowed Pakistan to build a hospital in Arunachal Pradesh, which China has been claiming without recognising the McMahon Line that demarcates the border.<br>It is significant that China has settled its border with Myanmar on the basis of the same McMahon Line.<br>While Pakistani media is abuzz with claims about large-scale infiltration of India’s external spy agency, RA&W, in the restive Balochistan and Sindh provinces, the Modi government’s assertions are only meant to underline its territorial claim and not destabilise the government in Islamabad.<br>Pakistan watchers believe that stories about an active RA&W could be a precursor to a terror attack in the Indian hinterland, Pakistani soil or Afghanistan, with the Indian agency being the perpetual fall guy.<br>By bringing the focus on PoK, India wants to clearly convey that it does not want either China or the US to interfere in its bilateral matters, that New Delhi is prepared to defend any fallout of the American withdrawal from Afghanistan and that it has the capacity to reach out to all principal players of the new game, including fundamentalists.<br>When US Secretary of State John Kerry met Modi on January 11 on the sidelines of the Vibrant Gujarat summit, he remarked that he was on his way to meet Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and offered to be a messenger.<br>Not one to take things lying down, Modi is said to have bluntly told Kerry that he should leave India and Pakistan to their fate (\“Humko apne naseeb par chodh do,\” were the words) and that both countries will settle their disputes themselves (\“Hum ladenge ya marenge ya dosti karenge, yeh aap hum pe chodh de.\”)";
